## blumilksoftware/codebase
A common codestyle helper for all Blumilk projects.

### Usage
Add package to our project:
```shell
composer require blumilksoftware/codestyle --dev
```

Then create `ecs.php` file in your project's root directory:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Blumilk\Codestyle\Config;

$config = new Config();

return $config->config();
```

#### Configuration
You can configure paths, set lists, skipped and additional rules in `Config` constructor:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Blumilk\Codestyle\Config;
use Blumilk\Codestyle\Configuration\Defaults\LaravelPaths;

$paths = new LaravelPaths();

$config = new Config(
    paths: $paths->filter("app", "tests")->add("src"),
);

return $config->config();
```

Or:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Blumilk\Codestyle\Config;
use Blumilk\Codestyle\Configuration\Defaults\Paths;

$config = new Config(
    paths: new Paths("src"),
);

return $config->config();
```

#### Usage with Composer

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ecs": "./vendor/bin/ecs check",
    "ecsf": "./vendor/bin/ecs check --fix"
  }
}
```

Then run following command to check codestyle:
```shell
composer ecs
```

or following to fix found errors:
```shell
composer ecsf
```
